# OTP-Email-Validator
"OTP Email Validator" is a full-stack MERN project that integrates Nodemailer for email verification through OTP during registration. Users receive an OTP via email and must enter it to verify their email before accessing the home page. This process ensures only verified emails can register, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access.
